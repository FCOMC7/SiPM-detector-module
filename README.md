# Open Source Hardware Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) Module [![Open Source Love](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/v1/open-source.svg?v=103)](https://github.com/ellerbrock/open-source-badges/)

This is our open-source hardware and custom electronics solution for SiPM module detector. It is used as part of "Ritmos,” our Real-time Technology for Microfluidic Droplet Sorting, as well as other microfluidics development projects. We implemented a board that includes the readout system to amplify SiPM signals to a measurable voltage with ultra-low noise, allowing the detection of a single photon. Additionally, a controllable voltage source is included, which enables the SiPM to be biased at different operating voltages. The readout provides a fast output with higher temporal resolution and a standard 50-ohm output with greater energy resolution. The SiPM detector module works with a single +5V power supply and a control voltage (Vctrl) in the range of 0-3.3V, allowing adjustment of the final SiPM bias voltage.
